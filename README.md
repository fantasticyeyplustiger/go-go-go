# Go! Go! Go!

A 2D rhythm game heavily inspired by the now discontinued game, "Mr. Oops!" by PONOS.
The player plays as a square that can move around on a 6x6 grid, dodging obstacles to the beat.

Made for my resume.

Additionally, there is a level editor built in for the game.

## Installation

Go to the [itch.io page](https://sticicefan.itch.io/go-go-go "Game Page") and download it there. Unfortunately, the zipfile is too big for me to put as a release...
Once you install and unzip it, however, you can launch the Godot executable from there.
