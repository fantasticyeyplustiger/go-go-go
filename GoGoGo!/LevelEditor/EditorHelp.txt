[i]This is the level editor guide![/i]

Before anything else, here is an important note. If you want to share a level to someone by giving them the level file, [b]you have to give them the song for the level too.[/b] I couldn't figure out a way to put the song data in the level data automatically, unfortunately.

Additionally, making the level faster or slower entirely depends on the BPM. As long as you have the song's BPM, you can just halve or double it accordingly.

The arrows / particles for obstacles will [i]always[/i] be 5 beats ahead.

[b]CTRL + Z DOES NOT EXIST. THERE IS NO UNDO AND REDO IN THIS EDITOR.[/b] It was too hard to code...

[b]Hotkeys:[/b]

- [b]CTRL + S[/b] : Saves the level.

- [b]CTRL + C[/b] : Copies the attacks on the current area of the chart you're on. DOES NOT COPY BACKGROUND EFFECTS, such as equalizer changes.

- [b]CTRL + V[/b] : Pastes the attacks you've copied onto the current area of the chart you're on. Doesn't work if you haven't copied anything.

- [b]CTRL + D[/b] : Copies the attacks on the current area of the chart you're on and pastes them on the next beat. THIS WILL OVERRIDE ATTACKS ON THAT NEXT BEAT, NO MATTER WHAT.

- [b]Right Mouse Click[/b] : If used to chart, the obstacle goes back in order.

- [b]Middle Mouse Click[/b] : If used to chart, it removes the obstacle at the button clicked.

[b]Buttons:[/b]

- [b]Quit[/b] : Exits the editor.

- [b]Play[/b] : Goes through the chart in the editor and plays the song at the beat you're on. Plays on the current beat!

- [b]Play Test[/b] : Makes you play the chart currently in the editor. If you haven't saved, it'll ask you to here. Plays on the current beat!

- [b]BPM[/b] : Beats per minute. Determines how fast the chart will play in-game. If it isn't syncing properly, you might want to search up an online BPM finder and find your song's BPM there accordingly!

- [b]Copy[/b] : Copies the attacks on the beat your on.

- [b]Paste[/b] : Pastes the attack you copied onto the current beat of the chart you're on.

- [b]Save[/b] : Saves your chart as an actual level.

- [b]Load[/b] : Lets you select a level to load into the editor!

- [b]Song Import[/b] : Lets you add a song into the Music folder by dragging and dropping a file. [b]USE OGG AUDIO FILES ONLY. MP3 FILES AND WAV FILES WILL NOT WORK.[/b]

- [b]End[/b] : Ends the level at this beat. If you don't put an end, the end will automatically be put at the end of the song.

- [b]Random Level[/b] : If it is turned on, the game will convert every "charted attack" into a "randomized attack." Randomized attacks do not save, so you won't lose any data if you decide to turn this on!

[b]CHART[/b]

- [b]Blank Squares[/b] : If you click on these, an obstacle will appear on that spot at that beat in the level. The obstacle's sprite will be shown for reference.

- - [b]Boulder[/b] : Deals 5 damage. Rolls down the row or column slowly.
- - [b]Rock Pellet[/b] : Deals only 1 damage. Speeds down the row or column at a fast speed.
- - [b]Steel Ball[/b] : Deals 5 damage. Rolls down the row or column twice as fast as a Boulder does.
- - [b]Iron Pellet[/b] : Deals only 1 damage. Speeds down the row or column twice as fast as a Steel Ball does.
- - [b]Laser[/b] : Deals 10 damage. Will attack an entire row or column instantly.

- [b]Equalizer[/b] : On that beat, the equalizer will change to match that "height." It will continue being that "height" until it is changed on another beat.

- [b]Gradient[/b] : On that beat, the gradient near the equalizers will change to match the new brightness. Likewise, it will continue being that bright until it is changed on another beat.

- [b]Gradient Pulse[/b] : On that beat, the gradient near the equalizers will pulse.
