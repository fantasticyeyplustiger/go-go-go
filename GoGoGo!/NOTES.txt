laser bean: kills player and destroys any objects that come in contact with it
- big orange arrow to indicate coming
- usually lasts for a second or two, but can last longer if modified by level creator

bouler: kills player, moves at a relatively slow speed in one direction
- small, red arrow to indicate coming

rock pebble: inflicts damage on player, moves 3x faster than boulder (4 kill player)
- sharp, red arrow to indicate coming

iron pebble: inflicts damage on player, moves 5x faster than boulder (2 kill player)
- sharp, blue arrow to indicate coming

steel bouler: goes slightly faster than bouler and isn't affected by laser beam, kills player
- small, blue arrow to indicate coming

exploding tile: explodes at a designated rhythm, but is safe for the most part. takes 2 hp from the player
if in the blast radius, kills the player if standing directly on it during explosion
- red circle and exclamation mark in the middle to indicate explosion

conveyor: moves the player in a certain direction every X seconds, doesn't affect obstacles

LEVEL MAKING SYSTEM:
	
	-- THE USER SHOULD SET A BPM INTO THE LEVEL. According to this BPM, the level should
	give out "guidelines" for when the level attacks the player.
	
		- It is important to note that the user should still have the ability to make attacks that
		are "off" the BPM. That way, they can make attacks based on the instrumental rather than
		the main melody, for example, similar to Geometry Dash.
	
	
	-- IN THE "GUIDELINES," the user has the ability to either send out a randomized set of obstacles
	(as for how random, the user can choose to a certain extent) OR the user can send out a
	specific, controlled amount of obstacles no matter what type or position.
	
		- For most obstacles, they will simply roll down the lane. However, exploding tiles and
		laser beams will be treated differently accordingly. For example, the laser beam will have
		a parameter to determine how long it should last, and the exploding tile should have a set
		rhythm to it.
		
		- To set an obstacle, click on one of the obstacle spawner positions and select an obstacle
		type. Each one has info on what the obstacle will do once spawned (speed, damage, etc.)
		
			- The obstacles should also have keybinds to automatically set them.
		
		
	
	
	-- THERE WILL BE A RECTANGULAR CHART at the bottom with circles that glow up when the melody of
	the song reaches it. To edit the guidelines, the user should click on the glowing circle or
	simply press a keybind assigned to it.
	
		- Each one of the guidelines represents a "wave" of obstacles.
		
		- If the guideline there has been edited, it will run an algorithm that determines how many
		different types of obstacles are in that wave, which one has the most obstacles, and put a
		sprite of the type with the most obstacles on the circle.
		
		- If the guideline there has been set to a randomized wave, it'll simply display
		the letter "R" on top of the circle.
